# ✅ Conclusion

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project was to **predict house sale prices** in Ames, Iowa using machine learning models, and to identify the best-performing model based on key evaluation metrics: **R² score** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

---

## 🗂️ About the Dataset
- The **Ames Housing dataset** contains **1,460 observations** of residential homes sold between 2006 and 2010.
- It includes **80+ features** covering property characteristics such as size, quality, location, and amenities.
- The target variable `SalePrice` was **log-transformed** to reduce skew and stabilize variance for better modeling.
